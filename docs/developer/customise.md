# Customising the experience

You can customise the appearance of a lot of details in the frontend service by editing the `tailwind.config.ts`. There are three colors that you can change. Use a **dark** color
        
```ts
colors: {
    bgaccent: '#242038', // Only used in `index.vue`; dark color for the feature grid
    primaryaccent: '#8D86C9', // Primary accent color, a darker purple
    secondaryaccent: '#9067C6', // Secondary accent color, a brighter purple
}
```
