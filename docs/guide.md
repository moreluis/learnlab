# User Guide

LearnLab provides learning with flashcards &ndash; powered by AI.

Special is the capability to generate flashcards from a website.

This is a research project, in order to demonstrate how AI can influence learning processes in education.

## Getting started

Flash cards are in stacks. These stacks can be reached from your dashboard (`/app`). By accessing a stack you will open learn mode.

### Learn mode

> Entering learn mode for the first time, you will see [multiple options to create cards](#add-new-cards).

Cards help you learn. You'll see a question, and when you click on the card with the question, the answer shows up. Then, you can evaluate whether you were right or wrong. Based on that, your card will be organized in the stack.

In learning mode, you can quickly change your stack.

### Edit stacks

When being in a stack, you can click on the `Modify` button in the top right corner. The modification menu will activate.

#### Change this card

You can change question and answer of the card you are currently seeing with the fields directly under it.

#### Add new cards

##### Manually add a new card to your stack

Add a new card to your stack manually by using the `Manual` field. Enter a question and answer and a card will be appended to your stack accordingly.

##### Paste cards from URL (AI)

You can create cards with AI by providing a website URL. Our service will extract the website text and generate cards using artificial intelligence.

Paste the URL of the website into the field and submit. The AI will process the website text and generate cards accordingly. This might take a while (up to a few minutes).

##### Paste cards from text (AI)

Additionally, artificial intelligence can generate cards directly from text.

Input your text (limited to 90,000 characters) in the designated text area and submit. Processing may take some time, up to a few minutes.

## Customisation

### Deprecated: Design (view type)

> The original view type was removed due to upgrade (%24.1). Only `newView` is now available for use.

> The whole application was built with a note-like folder structure for structure. For simplicity reasons, another structure was added.

~~Users can choose between two view types, that change the entire design. This can be set in your profile settings (`/profile`), which can be accessed with the account icon at the top right.~~
1. New view (simpler structure, set by default)
~~2. Old view (more complex structure, better for users with a lot of stacks)~~
